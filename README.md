A very simple kernel runs on Raspberry Pi
========
I am interested in bare-metal programming.

The goal of this project is:
	
	*   understand linker script (sections)
	*   interact between C and ARM assembly 
	*   how to setup an environment for C program
	*   how to interact with hardware peripherals
	*   use C if possible

I refer [Baking Pi - Operating Systems Development](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/) and create a template with my style.
There are some useful information from Baking Pi Project.
